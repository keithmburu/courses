## Course Description

This course provides a standard introduction to the fundamental concepts and techniques of modern computational linguistics theory and practice of computational linguistics research.  Linguistics is the study -- often the scientific study -- of language.  Computer science is the science of computing.  Computational linguistics is a broad, interdisciplinary field that overlaps significantly with cognitive science, artificial intelligence and machine learning, information theory, and probability and statistics, and other fields.  

In this course, we will cover the fundamental mathematics of probability and linear algebra necessary for modern machine learning approaches to computational linguistics and natural processing, and the material is heavily weighted toward hands-on projects.  We will also cover some fundamentals of linguistic inquiry.  Topics include fundamentals of probability and statistics, linear algebra, and information theory; linear models, regular expressions; neural networks; recursive neural networks; latent variable and graphical models; topic models; parsing and tagging; machine translation; word embeddings; semantics fundamentals; ethics, fairness, societal, and social issues; information retrieval; machine translation; and research fundamentals.  

In addition to the these topics, a significant portion of the course involves a substantial project, which students will work on throughout the semester in groups, culminating in a short paper and presentation.

Throughout the semester, we will also read and discuss the book *Race After Technology*, by Ruha Benjamin, giving students the opportunity to wrestle with the implications of the technologies about which they will learn in the course.

## Course Structure

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, this course will be entirely online.  The course will also be largely "flipped."  This means that, prior to class time, students are expected to watch lectures and complete the required readings.  During the lecture time, then, students will come prepared with questions, which will be submitted beforehand.  Participation in the class discussion board will also be mandatory.  The course [schedule](schedule.md) is preliminary and subject to change as the semester progresses.

If students cannot attend lectures due to circumstances beyond their control, they should notify the professor so that we can find an alternative arrangement.

### Assignment Submission

Assignments will be submitted to Moodle unless otherwise specified. Assignments not conforming to the specified guidelines will be returned ungraded, and a late penalty will be applied.

### Late Policy

All assignments are due on the day specified in Moodle.  Assignments submitted late may be subject to a late penalty of 10% off of the **maximum** possible grade per day.

### Communication

Students are free to e-mail me for any reason.  However, professors receive too much e-mail, and the best way to receive a fast response and jump to the front of the line is to contact me through Piazza.  I will check Piazza for student mail at 4:30pm every weekday. In general, messages received after 5pm on Friday or during holidays will be checked the next business day.   Students may also schedule one-on-one time through audio/video chat or through text-based live chatting, based on their preference.

### Academic Honesty

Some projects will be group-based, and all students are expected to substantially contribute.  For individual assignments, students' work should be their own.  While it is natural to consult online sources, students should not copy source code or attempt to find solutions online.  Students are required to either ask or answer at least one question per assignment on Piazza.

### Grading

There are multiple categories for assignments, and certain assignments will be worth more than others in each category.  The points are divided as follows:

| Category          |      |      |
| ----------------- | ---- | ---- |
| Homework and Labs | 25%  |      |
| Midterm           | 15%  |      |
| Participation     | 10%  |      |
| Final Project     | 50%  |      |
|                   |      |      |

Participation includes participation in the online discussion board, participation during class lectures, and participation in in-class discussion.  

### Other

Students who require accommodations of any kind should inform me in writing, preferably at the beginning of the semester.  Likewise, I encourage students who would like me to know their preferred pronouns or any other crucial information to inform me at the beginning of the semester.
