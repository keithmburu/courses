## Course Description

This course provides a standard introduction to the fundamental concepts and techniques of modern computational linguistics theory and practice of computational linguistics research.  Linguistics is the study -- often the scientific study -- of language.  Computer science is the science of computing.  Computational linguistics is a broad, interdisciplinary field that overlaps significantly with cognitive science, artificial intelligence and machine learning, information theory, probability and statistics, computational social science, and other fields.  

In this course, we will cover the fundamental mathematics of probability and linear algebra necessary for modern machine learning approaches to computational linguistics and natural processing, and the material is heavily weighted toward hands-on projects.  We will also cover some fundamentals of linguistic inquiry.  Topics include fundamentals of probability and statistics, linear algebra, and information theory; linear models, regular expressions; neural networks; recursive neural networks; latent variable and graphical models; topic models; parsing and tagging; machine translation; word embeddings; semantics fundamentals; ethics, fairness, societal, and social issues; information retrieval; machine translation; and research fundamentals.  

In addition to the these topics, a significant portion of the course involves a substantial project, which students will work on throughout the semester in groups, culminating in a short paper and presentation.

Throughout the semester, we will also read and discuss the book *Race After Technology*, by Ruha Benjamin, giving students the opportunity to wrestle with the implications of the technologies about which they will learn in the course.

### Course Structure

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, this course will be entirely online.  The course will also be somewhat (not entirely) "flipped."  This means that, prior to class time, students are expected to watch lectures and complete the required readings.  During the lecture time, then, students will come prepared with questions, which will be submitted beforehand.  Participation in the class discussion board will also be mandatory.  The course [schedule](schedule.md) is preliminary and subject to change as the semester progresses.  Some lectures may not be flipped (such as the first ones).

If students cannot attend lectures due to circumstances beyond their control, they should notify the professor so that we can find an alternative arrangement.

### Assignment Submission

Assignments will be submitted to Moodle unless otherwise specified. Assignments not conforming to the specified guidelines will be returned ungraded, and a late penalty will be applied.

All written assignments and reports must be written in Markdown or LaTeX.  The final project report must be written in LaTeX using a template for a major computational linguistics venue (ACL, EMNLP, Computational Linguistics, etc.).

### Late Policy

All assignments are due on the day specified in Moodle.  Assignments submitted late may be subject to a late penalty of 10% off of the **maximum** possible grade per day.

### Communication

Students are free to e-mail me for any reason.  However, professors receive too much e-mail, and the best way to receive a fast response and jump to the front of the line is to contact me through Piazza.  I will check Piazza for student mail at 4:30pm every weekday. In general, messages received after 5pm on Friday or during holidays will be checked the next business day.   Students may also schedule one-on-one time through audio/video chat or through text-based live chatting, based on their preference.

### Academic Honesty

Some projects will be group-based, and all students are expected to substantially contribute.  For individual assignments, students' work should be their own.  While it is natural to consult online sources, students should not copy source code or attempt to find solutions online.  Students are required to either ask or answer at least one question per assignment on Piazza.

### Grading

There are multiple categories for assignments, and certain assignments will be worth more than others in each category.  The points are divided as follows:

| Category          | Percentage |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| Homework and Labs | 25%        |
| Midterm           | 15%        |
| Participation     | 10%        |
| Final Project     | 50%        |
|                   |            |

Participation includes participation in the online discussion board, participation during class lectures, and participation in in-class discussion.  

### Final Project

The final exam will be a substantial group research project on a topic of the student's choosing, in consultation with the professor, resulting in a short (~4 page) research paper.  These will be presented in short presentations on the final day of class.  The final project will be due at the end of the final exam period.

### Departmental Collaboration Policy

Collaboration is critical to learning and the practice of programming, and thus is a fundamental part of students' current and future work in computer science. Our overall goal is to allow collaborative engagement that leads to individual understanding; this is realized, within the context of the Haverford Honor Code, through the details below. Note that, in all Haverford CS courses, each student that is part of a collaboration, or each student that is giving or receiving help, is responsible for making sure that this collaboration happens in a way that contributes to everyone’s growth and learning and is in accordance with the [Haverford Honor Code](http://honorcouncil.haverford.edu/the-code/).

When students work together in any way, all collaborators should be cited on the resulting assignment. Any outside sources (meaning anything other than your course textbook and your notes) should be similarly cited, though before using outside sources you should check with your professor to make sure outside sources are allowed. No outside sources are allowed on exams unless otherwise stated.

While collaboration is encouraged, there are also times when it can cross a line and be considered inappropriate help in violation of the Honor Code. The responsibility for ensuring this collaboration remains appropriate falls on all parties. Sometimes, it is easier for a student *providing* help to tell when they are crossing the line from collaboration to doing the work for the other student. Remember, it is never helpful to your friend to deny them the chance to learn the material.

Work done in collaboration should never be copied from another student (e.g., from their computer or from joint work on the board). Work from previous semesters should never be shared with current students, or looked at by students in the current semester, though it is fine to share notes you make about lectures or the textbook. Code and other material should never be copied from another student or outside sources unless permission is explicitly given *in advance* by your professor and the code is cited.

If you are uncertain about whether you have, or are about to, cross the line of acceptable collaboration, ask your instructor or the T.A. for the course, or consult our list of examples of appropriate collaboration on [details of this policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y0YBo4Zggx5XXuMuJ7hjLtk_kVdQtRLM0jSc_p-7FQs). As part of your education in CS, we expect you to develop an understanding of appropriate collaboration and attribution, and so it is fair/appropriate for an instructor to include exam questions about collaboration and this policy.

This policy resulted from a departmental discussion and was significantly influenced by [the policy at Grinnell](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/drupal6/taxonomy/term/578) and [the 2016-07-22 “Counting From Zero” blog post](http://blogs.whitman.edu/countingfromzero/2016/07/22/academic-honesty-guidelines) about a related policy at Whitman.

### Honor Code

The Haverford Honor Code encompasses both academic and social  spheres of life, influencing everything from the spirit of intellectual  inquiry to personal interactions. The Honor Code is not a set of rules,  but rather a document where students are able to present the ideals and  expectations of the current students on campus, emphasizing genuine  connection and engagement with one another, and the creation of an  atmosphere of **trust**, **concern**, and **respect**. The Honor Code is also completely student-run — one of the clearest demonstrations of this trust.

Some of the more concrete reflections of the Honor Code include  students taking tests without proctors and scheduling their own final  exams, the absence of RAs in the dorms, and the lack of an enrollment  deposit for admission. But the impact of the Honor Code goes much  deeper.

Haverford is a community of talented, motivated, and serious-minded  individuals, and yet Haverford is also a remarkably down-to-earth,  friendly place that values collaboration over cutthroat competition.  It’s a place where you will find an extraordinary sense of fun. The  Honor Code helps to create an environment in which students feel  comfortable and at home, and at the same time challenged, pushed, and  stretched.

While there are students on campus who think that the Honor Code is  not perfect, there are also students on campus who believe in the power  of the Code, and these two groups are not mutually exclusive. With an  Honor Code, students have the autonomy and the agency to change the  campus for the better. With that agency, comes struggle and strife, but  also reward.

Instituted in 1896, the Honor Code serves as one of Haverford’s  oldest and greatest traditions. But equally important as its history,  the Honor Code is a living, vital part of life at Haverford. In addition to the Honor Code being entirely student run, it must be re-ratified  each year by the student body. At an all-student session known as  Plenary, students gather to debate and revise the Honor Code, and a vote is taken. Real discussion occurs and real changes are made, making this a dynamic Honor Code over which the current student body has complete  ownership.

The Haverford traditions of student involvement and self-governance  go well beyond the Honor Code, too. Students’ Council has complete  control over the $400,000 activities budget. Students sit on all major  committees at the College, serve as representatives to the Board, and  even sit on hiring committees for new faculty. Drawing from our Quaker  roots, most decisions at Haverford are made by consensus, and the  student voice is valued on the same level as all others.

### Accommodations Statement

Haverford College is committed to providing equal access  to students with a disability. If you have (or think you have) a  learning difference or disability – including mental health, medical, or physical impairment – please contact the Office of Access and  Disability Services (ADS) at [hc-ads@haverford.edu](mailto:hc-ads@haverford.edu). The Director will confidentially discuss the process to establish reasonable accommodations.

Students who have already been approved to receive academic  accommodations and want to use their accommodations in this course  should share their verification letter and make arrangements to meet  with me as soon as possible to discuss their accommodations. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive and require advance notice to  implement.

It is a state law in Pennsylvania that individuals must be given  advance notice that they may be recorded. Therefore, any student who has a disability-related need to audio record this class must first be  approved for this accommodation from the Director of Access and  Disability Services and then must speak to me. Other class members need  to be aware that this class may be recorded.
