# Lectures and Labs
- I generally do not take attendance.
    - But I will if people stop coming to class.
- You are expected to do the required reading before class.

# Working in Class
- I will assume that you use lab machines.
- I am not technical support for people's individual machines.
- We will use the Unix/Linux command line.  
    - Easy for macOS or Linux users
    - Windows users need to install the Windows Subsystem for Linux
    - Or just use lab computers.

# Turning in Homework
- Follow the directions and produce professional-looking documents.
- Unless otherwise specified, all homework and reports must be typed in $\LaTeX$.
    - You may use Markdown with $\LaTeX$ unless otherwise specified.
- If you flout these directions, you will receive no credit.
- Assignments are due on time unless there is a serious emergency or advance permission was given.
    - **General Rule: If it's not turned in when I decide to grade, you won't receive credit.**
